Its a ML based based discord bot ,which tries to mimic Robo Rick and bring enhanced moderation to your server with some Rick and Morty flair! 


# What is a Discord Bot?

One of the most unique features of the multi-level communication platform Discord is its bots. Discord bots are AIs that can perform a number of useful automated tasks and Discord bot commands on your server. Currently my bot tries to mimic Rick. This is deployed hosted 24 X 7 in my server.

# How to create a bot?

I used dataset which was readily available in kaggle and trained them using ml model, later used Hugging Face to make the model conversational. The code is being run on repl.it as it is an online IDE that you can use on your web browser and doesn't require hosting. Finally used Uptime Robot to monitor website.
